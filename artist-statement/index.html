<p>Abby Linatoc Mendoza, ATR-P (they/she) is a second-generation Filipino American multidisciplinary artist from Chicago, IL. With a BFA in Painting from the Herron School of Art + Design and an MA in Art Therapy & Counseling from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Abby’s work in non-profit community youth/art education spaces informs their art, which primarily depicts children. Their process involves collage, found object, mending/sewing techniques, and oil painting, bringing together techniques learned from formal, “traditional” education with explorations of recycled/craft materials. Through self-reflexive artwork that examines memory and the act of archiving/collecting, Abby aims to create dialogue on building systems of care.</p>

<p>Past work examined the perpetual foreigner and impostor syndrome through saturated colors and playing with a scale between the subject and the background in reference to Godzilla to illustrate immigrant alienism and “the other”.  They spent a large part of their early life investigating their identity as a Filipino-American and how it informs who they are as a queer artist, facilitator, leader, daughter, sibling, and human being.  Being in community with other artists who use their skills in service of collective liberation led Abby to think beyond “the self” and explore ways that art can be used to reimagine educational systems and community wellness.  As they learn more about their humanness and their roots, they try to apply that growth to their work, knowing their practice is versatile and beyond the many titles and roles they hold. This results in both a teaching/mentoring style and current artmaking process that is reflective yet whimsical and playful.  Abby’s artwork has been shown in galleries across Chicago, Kansas City, Wichita, Indianapolis, and Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Abby is available for freelance work in design, murals, portraiture, and youth art workshops.  For a full portfolio + resume, contact via email.</p>
